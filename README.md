## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
I learned so much while doing this project! My flexbox skills were rusty and this helped me get back into it. I also was unaware of how to properly lay a transparent gradient over an image. I learned that it's easier to set the image as the background of a div instead of trying to manipulate the image itself. This also helped me brush up on the things CSS can do with backgrounds.

I also learned a bit more about semantic HTML. I didn't realize I could use tags like h1 and style them as needed instead of cluttering things with class names. Pretty neat!

### Continued development
There are still a few small issues with the responsive part of the design. I will probably return after I'm a little more experienced and try to iron them out.
